### Course Title: Operating Systems Laboratory

# Course Objective:

- The goal of this course is to have students understand and appreciate the principles in the design and implementation of operating systems software.

# Lab Course Outline:
Introduction to operating systems concepts, process management, memory management, file systems, virtualization, and distributed operating systems. The laboratory exercises will include familiarization with UNIX system calls for process management and inter-process communication; Experiments on process scheduling and other operating system tasks through simulation/implementation.


Students must submit the assignments they are asked to do and upload via  commands on GitHub. There is a final project at the end of the course that will ask students to submit a project for a simple operating system that they have designed.
